# Gemotion

Gemotion is a webapp to rate games according to your emotions.<br/>
[See here the live version](http://fgc-gemotion.herokuapp.com/)


The idea of this project is to use players’ emotions to create a new way to analyse video games. The webapp aims to collect data about how users feel playing or watching a specific title. 
Common game evaluations found online normally focus on genre, score or graphics. Even if those aspects are meaningful, they can create an image of the game based only on its surface. But when we’re looking at a game review online, we may look for something beyond what it looks from the outside.

Analyzing a game strictly by the emotion it triggers can create different connections among games, certainly in a wider spectrum. After all, when we are looking for a game recommendation our main goal is to find something that will make us feel in a certain way.

## Testing


### The games database chicken API x RAWG 

To develop a game reviewing database, the first thing needed was data about those games. After researching something "easy" to use, I found the chicken coop gaming database on rapidapi.com. This website was very useful to test the API mechanics. In a short period of time, I had tested the game search and game details functionalities on my on python test file, found on tests/chickenAPI.

Happy with the functionality I was going to work with, I jumped to Adobe XD to plan the [wireframes](https://fergabi17.github.io/gemotion/resources/UX/wireframes/wireframes.html) based on how chicken coop worked. A couple of weeks later, with the planning ready and beginning of execution complete, I was surprised to find out that this API was no longer working. For some reason it was failing to return data requested, and I had to go back to look for a replacement API ASAP.

After a couple of days and tests, RAWG API was set as the new game database for this project. At the beginning this API seemed to be more complex that the first one since it was storing a lot more data. But with the help of rapidapi.com, I could understand this new API's behavior and start setting an even richier database than I was planning to have.

### Naming emotions and creating fixtures

The core of this webapp are the reviews, and reviews are based on emotions. To have those emotions selected and than set into categories, I used a psychology [website](http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/assess/feelings.html) as a base and edited those according to what seemed more appropriate for the gaming experience. This was more challenging than expected! Seeing emotions on a list one beside the other is different that testing its use on the website's layout. Because of this, the emotions list was a work in progress for a while, and I tested them directly on the website to understand how the emotions presented were the appropriate ones.

The emotions list and their categories were added to the database using fixtures. Considering there were 192 emotions in 16 categories at the end, to manually build and edit fixtures would be a quite extensive work. This way, I built a side tool: a python script that would read a csv and create the json file with the list of emotions needed. This way I could constantly test the review functionality and quickly edit fixtures when needed. You can find this tool on resources/fixture-builder

### Review page

One of the most laborious parts of this webapp was the review page. Initially planned to be a simple form with checkboxes for each emotion (you can check this on the [wireframes](https://fergabi17.github.io/gemotion/resources/UX/wireframes/wireframes.html)), at the production stage this seemed too overwhelming. Considering 192 emotions, it would be a very discouraging and even boring form. Since this webapp was aiming to have a modern look, I looked for other options that would be more motivating to the users add their inputs.

- input autocomplete
The input autocomplete was the first idea to make a clean review page. To build this functionality, I used the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oLVZp1NQVE&ab_channel=CodeBand), so the autocomplete would be directly linked to the list of emotions on the database. To show the selection of emotions made, I created a board with tags based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha4xwcJXwow&ab_channel=FrontendTips). With the help of some javascript, adding new emotions is now more visually appealing than with the long form. But during tests realized, a blank text input could look a bit scary for less creative people, and the review process could be very limited. Realized this, I acknowledged the need of a list from where users could actually choose from.

- collapse categories
Simply creating a list of emotions to choose would bring us back at the beginning of the issue: this would look too overwhelming. Looking on Bootstrap documentation, I found the collapse categories that looked the perfect match for what I was trying to reach. Even though this functionality can be easily applied, on gemotion this became a little bit more complex because two levels of collapse were needed: first to reveal categories and a second to reveal the group of emotions. After checking some tips on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) of how to build django templates with loops and the collapse functionality I could figure out how to use the forloop.counter to match the button with the correct list of emotions and the data-parent html attribute to make the collapse elements open in the same position.

### Charts settings

Charts JS is an awesome tool to create charts, I was very happy with it. At the beginning only one chart was created on the game reviews page. For this, setting the chart was very easy and straightforward. As the game reviews page was growing, more information and different types of charts were added; from this point some problems on chart rendering started to appear. After carefully reading the documentation on chartsjs and this [tutorial](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-chartjs-radar-and-polar-area-charts--cms-28444) I could understand that different charts needed different settings, and they couldn't all be set together. It was evident there was a need of separating settings per chart on the javascript file.

### Profile logged x not logged

Since the wireframes planning, the profile page was intended to be showed for logged and not logged users. For the logged user it would show a statistics panel and chart about their reviews. For not logged or not users, it would show the same page with no statistics and some question marks in place of content. This idea would be to show not users how the website could gather their info and present to them if they create an account. 

After testing different cases, some issues were found about how to render the page for:
- A new user that had no reviewed content
- A not logged user posting a review

This was re-worked on the profile view so we could distinctively consider those 3 scenarios and process data on a distinct way for each one.

### Website usability

On the test phase, different browsers were used. Even though the appearance appeared to change in different browsers, this visual change didn't impact any of the webapp functionalities or performance.
- Google chrome (desktop and mobile)
- Safari (desktop and mobile)
- Mozilla Firefox

During these manual tests, the main functionalities that were tested can be listed here:
- Functional links
- Links to other websites open on a new tab
- Navigating back and forth doesn't break paths
- Information easily found
- Readability
